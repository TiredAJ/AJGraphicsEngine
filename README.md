!!! Project is currently on hold as I work on my final year project !!!

# AJGraphicsEngine
(not sure of it's technically a "Graphics Engine", but oh well)

### So imagine the [P5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/) web editor, but C# and shit. That's what this is aiming for. You write your code into "DrawParameter.cs", compile then watch as shit happens. The [Examples](https://github.com/TiredAJ/AJGraphicsEngine/tree/main/Examples) folder I'll be populating with demos.

# Rough Roadmap

- [ ] Proper graphics - currently looking into [Silk.net](https://dotnet.github.io/Silk.NET/) and learning how OpenGL & shaders work <- priority
- [ ] Roslyn - I really need to work out how Roslyn works because I'd like it to compile the user's code at runtime
- [ ] Misc admin - the examples folder needs more stuff, the wiki needs finishing and I ought to make a video demo on how to use this
- [ ] think of other cool ideas to add
- [ ] Profit??? (/j)
