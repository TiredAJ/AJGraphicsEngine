# AJGraphicsEngine
(not sure of it's technically a "Graphics Engine", but oh well)

### So imagine the [P5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/) web editor, but C# and shit. That's what this is aiming for. You write your code into "DrawParameter.cs", compile then watch as shit happens. The current demo is a WIP based off the Coding Train's Ray Marching video. The [Examples](https://github.com/TiredAJ/AJGraphicsEngine/tree/main/Examples) folder I'll be populating with demos.

this currently uses the System.Drawing2D (GDI+?) graphics library, but that might change (a potential being NGraphics)
